    PDS.pm

SYNOPSIS
        use PDS;
        PDS->login unless $pds_handle;
        my $pds = PDS->new( $pds_handle );
        my $error = PDS->error;
        if ( $error ) {
            print $error;
        } else {
            my $id = $pds->userid;
            my $group = $pds->group;
        }

DESCRIPTION
    Allows scripts to use Ex Libris Patron Directory Service (PDS) to manage
    user logins.

    Scripts can be run after login by adding the script URL as a parameter
    on the PDS login link, e.g. from the URL:

        https://our.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/pds
        ?func=load-login&institute=61ADELAIDEU&calling_system=primo&lang=eng
        &url=https://library.adelaide.edu.au/cgi/ourscript

    Alternatively the script can force a login with PDS->login, which will
    return to the calling script.

    Username is obtained by calling PDS back with the bor-info function,
    which should return an XML data structure like so:

        <bor>
            <bor_id>
                <id>1234567</id>
                <handle>6820141643591607825054665244825</handle>
                <institute>61ADELAIDE_INST</institute>
            </bor_id>
            <bor-info>
                <id>1234567</id>
                <id>Stephen</id>
                <institute>61ADELAIDE_INST</institute>
                <name>Stephen</name>
                <group>STAFF</group>
                <email_address>stephen.thomas@adelaide.edu.au</email_address>
            </bor-info>
        </bor>

METHODS
  PDS->new( $pds_handle );
    Retrieves the details of the logged in user from PDS.

    If the script is called on return from PDS, there will be a handle,
    otherwise we can redirect to PDS to get one.

  PDS->login
    Redirect to PDS login form, returning to our calling script and
    preserving query parameters.

  PDS->error
    Return any error as a string. Returns the empty string if no errors.

  $pds->userid;
    Return the id of the logged-in user.

  $pds->group;
    Returns the group of the logged-in user.
